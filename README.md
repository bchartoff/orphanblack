Orphan Black: Data viz. 

Orphan Black, a scifi thriller from BBC America and Space, stars Canadian actor Tatiana Maslany as several clones, products of a secret military experiment. All twenty episodes have featured at least one multiple-clone scene. After the first season, a slew of reviews reported that she must be 99 percent of the show. I decided to test that claim.

After two seasons, there are 831.5 minutes of Orphan Black and 827.6 minutes of Tatiana Maslany.

The data for this page were collected using a strict, consistent, and highly enjoyable but not peer-reviewed method of rewatching all twenty episodes with a spreadsheet open and one hand on the pause button. Scene changes or other breaks less than 10 seconds were ignored. Recaps, title scenes, credits, and previews were excluded from analysis.

Visualizations built in d3. Tools used along the way:
* Excel: collecting data
* R: formatting and cleaning data, initial visualizations (ggplot2)
* Python: CSV -> JSON

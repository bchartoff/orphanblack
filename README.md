Orphan Black: Data viz. Because obviously.

Orphan Black, a scifi thriller from BBC America and Space, stars Canadian actor Tatiana Maslany as several clones, products of a secret military experiment. She has played nine characters so far, with every episode featuring at least one multiple-clone scene. After the first season, a slew of reviews reported that she must be 99 percent of the show. I decided to test that claim.
